\item The airline company FlyMoar claims that of regularly scheduled flighs, departures and arrivals are on time $83$\% and $82$\% of the time, respectively.   The probability that a flight arrives and departs on time is $78$\%. % PS Ex 2.33
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the probability that one of FlyMoar's flights arrived on time given that it departed on time?
\ans{ Let $A, D$ be the event that arrivals and departures are on time, respectively.
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(A \cap D)}{P(D)} = \frac{.78}{.83} = \Sexpr{round(.78/.83, 2)}.\]
}
  \item What is the probability that one of FlyMoar's flights departed on time given that it arrived on time?
\ans{ 
\[ P(D|A) = \frac{P(A \cap D)}{P(A)} = \frac{.78}{.82} = \Sexpr{round(.78/.82, 2)}.\]
}

  \end{enumerate}

\item Suppose that $3.5$\% of all Americans and $1$\% of all Canadians lock their computer with a password.  A person is sampled randomly from a summit on North American culture where $40$\% of the summit is Canadians and $60$\% is Americans. % PSR ex 2.5-13

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Find the probability that this randomly sampled North American locks their computer with a password.
\ans{
\[P(lock) = P(U.S.\ \cap lock) + P(Canada \cap lock) = 0.035*.6 + 0.01*.4 = \Sexpr{round(0.035*.6 + 0.01*.4, 2)} \]
}
  \item If the person is known to lock their computer with a password, what is the probability that the person lives in the states?
\ans{
\[ P(U.S.\ | lock) = \frac{P(U.S.\ \cap lock)}{P(lock)} = \frac{0.035*0.6}{\Sexpr{round(0.035*.6 + 0.01*.4, 2)}} = \Sexpr{round(0.035*0.6/(0.035*.6 + 0.01*.4), 2)}. \]
} 
  \end{enumerate}
\item Suppose a card is drawn from a standard deck of cards.  Let $A$ be the event that the card drawn is an eight, and $B$ be the event that the card drawn is an ace.  Are these two events independent? % PSR 2.5-13
\ans{Dependent, since
\[ P(Ace \cap Eight) \ne P(Ace)P(Eight). \]
}
\end{enumerate}
