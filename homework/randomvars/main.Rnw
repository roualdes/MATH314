\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the expected value of the random variable described in Table~\ref{tab:X}?
\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
    $x$ & $1$ & $2$ & $3$ & $4$ \\
    \hline
    $P(X = x)$ & $0.4$ & $0.3$ & $0.2$ & $0.1$ \\
  \end{tabular} % example 3.2-3, what is the PMF?

\item Provide the \texttt{R} code to justify the 68, 95, 99.7 rule.  (Hint: use \texttt{pnorm}.)

\item Suppose adult heights are distributed normally with a mean of $70$ inches and a standard deviation of $4$ inches.  What is the probability we randomly select an adult who is between $64$ and $78$ inches tall?

\item The lifetime of a Sturdy Light light bulb follows an exponential distribution with an expected value (mean) of 180 days.  (Hint: how does the expected value relate to the parameter of the exponential distribution?  Which does \texttt{pexp} take as its argument?)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Whatâ€™s the probability a randomly chosen light bulb from Sturdy Light will fail within 160 days?  
  \item How long do $75$\% of the light bulbs from Sturdy Light last?
  \end{itemize}

\item Assume $X \sim U(a, b)$ is a continuous random variable.  Calculate the expected value of the random variable $X$.  Provide your work.
