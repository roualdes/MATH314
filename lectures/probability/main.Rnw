\section{Sample Space and Events}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Sample Space}
  Probability is interested in outcomes of experiments (observational studies, games, $\ldots$).  

  \begin{block}{sample space}
    A sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment, commonly denoted $\mathcal{S}$.
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{event}
    An event is any subset of the sample space.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Sample Space, examples}
  Here are some examples of sample spaces:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> two websites that are classified as defective or non-defective
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<2-> $\{NN, DN, ND, DD\}$
    \end{itemize}
  \item<3-> a survey about people's belief in the future lifespan (in years, say) of PHP
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<4-> $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, 5\}$
    \end{itemize}
  \item<5-> re PHP: each response is recorded as the average of 3 sequential respondents beliefs
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<6-> \texttt{R}?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Event, examples}
  Here are some examples of events corresponding to the sample spaces above:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> defective (D) or non-defective websites
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> both work $== \{NN\}$, neither works $== \{DD\}$, at least one works $== \{ND, DN\}$
    \end{itemize}
  \item<2-> beliefs about lifespan of PHP in years
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<3-> $\{3\}$ or $\{0, 1, 2 \}$
    \end{itemize}
  \item<4-> $\{1/3\}$ or $\{2/3\}$ or $\{1/3, 2\}$ or $\ldots$
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Set Operations}
  If we are dealing so heavily with sets, you can imagine we should rehearse set operations.  Let's try to make this a bit more lively, you guys draw them out.

  \begin{block}{union}
    The union of $k$ sets $A_j$ is the event consisting of $A_1$ or (not xor) $A_2$ or $\ldots$ $A_k$.  Mathematically, we write $\cup_{j=1}^k A_j$.  This is also thought of as at least one of $A_j$ happens.
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{intersection}
    The intersection of $k$ sets $A_j$ is the event consisting of $A_1$ and $A_2$ and $\ldots$ $A_k$.  Mathematically, we write $\cap_{j=1}^k A_j$.  This is also thought of as all of $A_1, \ldots, A_k$ happen.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Set Operations}
  \begin{block}{complement}
    The complement $A^c$ of $A$ is the set of events that are not in $A$.
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{difference}
    The difference $B - A$ is the set of events contained in $B$ but not in $A$.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Set Operations}
    \begin{block}{disjoint}
      Two sets $A$ and $B$ are disjoint (or mutually exclusive) if $A$ and $B$ do not overlap, i.e.\ have no events in common.  Mathematically, we write $A \cap B = \emptyset$.
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{subset}
    The set $A$ is said to be a subset of $B$ is all events in $A$ implies an event of the set $B$.  Mathematically, we write $A \subseteq B$.  Mathematically, we write $a \in A$ implies $a \in B$.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Subsets}
Some notes on subsets:
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Sometimes people will use the symbol $\subset$ to explicitly state that $A$ is a subset of $B$, but certainly not equal to $B$.
\item<2-> To show that $A = B$, one needs to show both that $x \in A$ implies $x \in B$ and that $x \in B$ implies $x \in A$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Laws of Set Operations}
There are well established laws of sets, analogous to laws of mathematics.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> Commutative: $A \cup B = B \cup A$ and $A \cap B = B \cap A$.
  \item<2-> Associative: $(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)$ and $(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)$.
  \item<3-> Distributive: $C \cap (A \cup B) = (C \cap A) \cup (C \cap B)$ and $C \cup (A \cap B) = (C \cup A) \cap (C \cup B)$.
  \item<4-> De Morgan's Laws: $(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$ and $(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Let's Be Real}
  Set operations, laws of set operations, and/or any combination of these don't come up very often.  But I promise you this: if you can drop some set logic in a time of need at any future career you have $\ldots$ mad street cred.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Connecting Sets and Probability}
  \textbf{Probability} is formally defined as an abstract mathematical operation that maps sets to the interval $[0, 1]$.  If we let $\mathcal{E}$ be the set of all possible events of $\mathcal{S}$, then mathematically we write  $P: \mathcal{E} \rightarrow [0,1]$.

More tangibly:
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> $P(H) = 0.5$ reads, the probability of flipping a head is $1/2$.
\item<2-> much of the rest of this class is talking about the probability of different events, $E$ or $H$ or $\ldots$ pick an event.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Probability, from where}
  The idea of probability comes from a \textbf{limiting relative frequency}.  Conceptually, the limiting relative frequency is the probability of observing event $E$ under infinite replications of the experiment of interest.  Let $N_n(E)$ denote the number of occurrence of $E$ after $n$ replications.  We interpret the probability of an event $E$, namely $P(E)$, as

\[ \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{N_n(E)}{n}. \]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Probability, example}
  We all claim to know the probability of flipping a head on a fair coin.  But, does one flip justify our intuition?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> What is the sample space of flipping a coin?
  \item<3-> What is one event?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Probability as a Model}
  As you can imagine, this is an inefficient method of defining probabilities -- are going to sit and flip a coin forever?  Play Texas Hold'em until the end of time?  Instead we think of probability models, the formal assignment of probabilities to events.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Equally Likely Outcomes}
  The most common probability models are those consisting of finite sample spaces, where each of $N$ outcomes is equally likely to occur:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> coin flip: $\mathcal{S} = \{H, T\}$, $P(H) = 1/2$
  \item<2-> die roll: $\mathcal{S} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$, $P(\text{roll } 1) = 1/6$
  \item<3-> If $N$ elements in $\mathcal{S}$, then $P(E) = N(E)/N$
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Probability, example}
  Imagine you roll two (fair) dice.  What is the probability of the event $E = \{ R_1 + R_2 = 7 \}$?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> What is the sample space?
    % \begin{itemize}
    % \item<5-> $\mathcal{S} = \{ (1,1), (1,2), \ldots, (6,6) \}$ implies $N=36$.
    % \end{itemize}
  \item<3-> How many ways can we roll a sum of $7$?
    % \begin{itemize}
    % \item<5-> $E = \{ (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) \}$ implies $N(E) = 6$.
    % \end{itemize}
  \item<4-> The elements of $E$ are disjoint and equally likely
  \item<5-> Answer: $P(E) = 1/6$ % P((1,6)) + P((2,5)) + \ldots + P((6,1)) = 6/36
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Motivating Conditional Probability}
  Wouldn't it be great if there was a formal method to update probabilities given new information.  Consider this scenario.  You draw a card from a deck of $52$ cards and then learn that the card you drew is a face card.  What is the probability that this card is a king?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> There's $12$ face cards.
  \item<3-> $4$ of the $12$ face cards are kings.
  \item<4-> Therefore, there's a $1/3$ probability that the card you drew is a king.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Motivating Conditional Probability}
  Without the learned knowledge that the card you drew is a face card, the probability of drawing a king is $4/52 = \Sexpr{round(4/52, 2)}$.  But after incorporating this new knowledge, the probability of drawing a king is $1/3 = \Sexpr{round(1/3, 2)}$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Conditional Probability}
  Conditional probability allows us to update probabilities given a new set of information; e.g.\ we learned that the card we drew was a face card.

  \begin{block}{conditional probability}
    For any two events $A$ and $B$
    \[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}, \]
    so long as $P(A) > 0$.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Conditional Probability, example}
  Let $A$ be the probability that we draw a face card and let $B$ be the probability that we draw a king.

  \[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)} = \frac{P(\text{face card and king})}{P(\text{face card})} = \frac{4/52}{12/52}. \]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Conditional Probability, example 2}
  Suppose you are working with a city planner (traffic engineer?) to synchronize two consecutive intersections' stop lights.  The planner claims that if the first light is green the second light will be green with probability $0.75$.  Assume the probability of finding the first light green is $0.55$.  What is the probability that any given driver will breeze through both lights?

\only<2->{Let $P(A) = 0.55$ and $P(B|A) = 0.75$.  We want to find $P(A \cap B)$.}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Motivating Law of Total Probability}

We now have a method for finding the probability of the intersection of two events, $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B|A)$.  Sometimes though we are given information about conditional probabilities, $P(B|A_j)$ for events $j= 1, \ldots, k$, and we need to recover $P(B)$.  

\begin{figure}
  \center
  \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{figs/totalprobability.jpg}
\end{figure}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Motivating Law of Total Probability}

Visually, we could sum the probabilities of the intersections of $B$ with each $A_j$,

\[ P(B) = P(A_1 \cap B) + P(A_2 \cap B) + \ldots + P(A_k \cap B). \]

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Law of Total Probability}
The law of total probability combines this idea with the formula from conditional probability.

\begin{block}{Law of Total Probability}
  \[ P(B) = P(A_1)P(B|A_1) + P(A_2)P(B|A_2) + \ldots + P(A_k)P(B|A_k) \]
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Law of Total Probability, example 2 continued}
Suppose further that we know, if the driver approaches a red traffic light first, then the second light will be green with probability $0.9$\%.  What is the probability that a driver will find the second traffic light green?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Law of Total Probability, example 2 continued}
We want to find the probability the second traffic light is green.  What do we know?

\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Know
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> probability first light is green, $P(A) = 0.55.$
  \item<1-> probability first light is red, $1 - P(A) = P(A^c) = 0.45$
  \item<1-> probability second light is green, given first light is green, $P(B|A) = 0.75$
  \item<1-> probability second light is green, given first light is red, $P(B|A^c) = 0.9$
  \end{itemize}
\item<2-> Want
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> $P(B)$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Law of Total Probability, example 2 continued}
  Find the probability that the first traffic light is green given that the second traffic light is green.  

\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Know
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> $P(A) = 0.55.$
  \item<1-> $P(A^c) = 0.45$
  \item<1-> $P(B|A) = 0.75$
  \item<1-> $P(B|A^c) = 0.9$
  \item<1-> $P(B) = 0.8175$
  \end{itemize}
\item<2-> Want
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> $P(A|B)$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Bayes' Theorem}
  Conditional probability combined with the law of total probability, written in all generality (and that we just used), is known as Bayes' Theorem.

  \begin{block}{Bayes' Theorem}
    \[ P(A_j|B) = \frac{P(A_j)P(B|A_j)}{\sum_{i=1}^k P(A_i)P(B|A_i)} \]
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\section{Independence}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Motivating Independence}
  It is through probability that we formalize statements like

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> two coin flips have nothing to do with each other
  \item<3-> the probability of rollig a $1$ is the same as rolling a $2$
  \item<4-> $\ldots$
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Independence, intuition}
  The intuition of independence is mathematically defined via conditional probability,

\[ P(B|A) = P(B). \]

That is the probability of $B$ does not depend on $A$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Independence}
The formal definition of independence is a condition that need be checked to state that two events are independent.

\begin{block}{independence}
Two events $A$ and $B$ are said to be independent if 
  \[ P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B). \]
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Independence, example}
Suppose you roll a fair die twice.  Let $A$ be the first roll is odd and let $B$ be the second roll is $4$ or $6$.  Are the events independent?

\begin{itemize}
\item<2-> $P(A \cap B)$
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<3-> From two rolls there are $36$ outcomes. $A \cap B$ has $6$ possible outcomes; $3$ (odd) $\times 2$ ($4$ or $6$). Therefore $P(A \cap B) = 6/36$.
  \end{itemize}
\item<4-> $P(A)$ and $P(B)$
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<5-> $P(A) = 1/2$ and $P(B) = 1/3$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
