## 1. Randomly generate a reasonable number of observations from the gamma distribution.
## You must pick two parameters: shape and rate.
## ?rgamma

## 2. Make a histogram of your randomly generated gamma variables.
## Describe the sample distribution using keywords from this class.
## ?qplot

## 3. Write the likelihood function that we will maximize.
## l(theta|x_1, ..., x_n)

## 4. Maximize your function above using R's optimizer funciton optim.
## ?optim
## The method "L-BFGS-B" is one of the more recent and more stable algorithms.
